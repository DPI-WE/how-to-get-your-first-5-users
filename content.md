## Overview

This lesson provides a straightforward approach to acquiring your first five users for your new app. You will learn techniques for engaging with users without resorting to hard sells, making the process feel organic and comfortable for both you and your potential users.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Understand effective strategies for reaching out to potential users.
2. Use conversational techniques to engage users without pressure.
3. Develop personalized messaging that encourages responses.
4. Recognize the importance of feedback and user interaction.

## 10 Step Guide

### 1. Understand Your Audience

Before reaching out, take time to understand your potential users. Identify their needs, preferences, and pain points. Creating user personas can help you visualize who your target users are and how your app can benefit them.

### 2. Build Your Contact List

- **Leverage Existing Networks**: Compile a list of contacts from your social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn), phone and email.
- **Prioritize Quality over Quantity**: Focus on connections who might genuinely be interested in your app.

### 3. Choose the Right Communication Platform

Select the platform where you have the most comfort and connections. If you have more contacts on LinkedIn, start there. If Instagram feels more natural, use that.

### 4. Crafting Your Message

- **Be Personal**: Start with a personalized greeting. Mention something specific about them to show that you care.
- **Be Relatable**: Use informal language that feels friendly rather than salesy.

#### Example Messages:
- "Hey [Name], I saw your post about [specific topic]. It resonated with me because [reason]."
- "Hi [Name], I noticed you recently started [activity]. I'm working on something that might help with that!"

### 5. Start the Conversation

- **Avoid Hard Selling**: Instead of pitching your product immediately, ask open-ended questions to engage them.

#### Conversation Starters:
- "What challenges do you face with [related topic]?"
- "Have you tried any solutions for [problem]? I'd love to hear about your experience."

### 6. Use the ACA Framework

Utilize the ACA (Acknowledge, Compliment, Ask) framework to guide your interactions:

1. **Acknowledge**: Reference something recent in their life or work.
2. **Compliment**: Offer a sincere compliment.
3. **Ask**: Pose a question related to your app or service.

#### Example ACA Message:

> "Hey [Name], I loved your recent post about [topic]! 
> (wait for response)
> You have a great way of explaining things.
> (wait for response)
> I'm working on an app that helps with [related problem]. Do you know anyone who might be interested?"

Remember, this is a *conversation* and you are talking with a fellow human. Make sure to listen and allow the conversation to flow naturally.

### 7. Encourage Referrals

If the person seems engaged, encourage them to refer others.

> "Do you know anyone who might find this interesting? I'd appreciate an introduction!"

### 8. Offer Value

When reaching out, make sure you're offering something of value in return:
- **Free Trials**: Consider offering free access to your app in exchange for feedback.
- **Exclusive Insights**: Share insights or resources that may help them.

### 9. Follow Up Gently

If you donâ€™t hear back:
- **Be Patient**: Give it some time before following up. If a week passes without a reply, send a gentle nudge.

#### Example Follow-Up:

> "Hi [Name], I hope you're well! I just wanted to follow up on my last message. I'm still curious about your thoughts on [related topic]."

### 10. Gather Feedback

Once users show interest:
- **Ask for Feedback**: Engage them in a conversation about their experience and thoughts on your app. This will help you refine your product and show users that you value their opinions.
